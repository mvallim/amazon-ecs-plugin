Enable this setting to keep agents online after running a job. Keeping agents online can help greatly speed up job start time, at the expense of keeping the ECS tasks running constantly. If your jobs running on these agents write files to disk, it's a good idea to use the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/ws-cleanup/">Workspace Cleanup</a> plugin.
<p>
Retained agents are still subject to termination if they remain idle for "Container Cleanup Timeout" minutes.
